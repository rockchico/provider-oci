                      Minimum and maximum values depend on the compute model and whether

                      For an Autonomous Database Serverless instance, the 'ECPU' compute
                      model requires a minimum value of one, for databases in the

                      when using the computeModel parameter. When using cpuCoreCount
                      parameter, it is an error to specify computeCount to a non-null
                      value. Providing computeModel and computeCount is the preferred

                    description: (Updatable) The compute amount available to the database.
                      Minimum and maximum values depend on the compute model and whether
                      the database is an Autonomous Database Serverless instance or
                      an Autonomous Database on Dedicated Exadata Infrastructure.
                      For an Autonomous Database Serverless instance, the 'ECPU' compute
                      model requires a minimum value of one, for databases in the
                      elastic resource pool and minimum value of two, otherwise. Required
                      when using the computeModel parameter. When using cpuCoreCount
                      parameter, it is an error to specify computeCount to a non-null
                      value. Providing computeModel and computeCount is the preferred
                      method for both OCPU and ECPU.

                      a non-null value. ECPU compute model is the recommended model
